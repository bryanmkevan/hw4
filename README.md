## Bryan Kevan Blog Post: lime v0.4: The Kitten Picture Edition (Magick, tensorflow)

For my blog post replication, I implemented the code on the tensorflow blog for image recognition on a selection of google search results to test its accuracy. The first part of the app pulls the top images on google for a given search term, and determines the percentage of them the lime algorithm can identify correctly. 

The second part of kittens.R determines the top 15 items that the algorithm identified in its results for the set of pictures. 

The algorithm works pretty well for pizzas (65% accuracy), and less well for bagels (45%).
